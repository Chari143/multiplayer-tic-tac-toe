Multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Nakama
Backend
Problem Statement
Build a production-ready, multiplayer Tic-Tac-Toe game with
server-authoritative architecture using Nakama as the backend
infrastructure.
Technical Requirements
Frontend
● Choose your preferred tech stack (React, React Native, Flutter, Unity, etc.)
● Implement responsive UI optimized for mobile devices
● Display real-time game state updates
● Show player information and match status
Backend (Nakama)
Core Requirements
❖ Server-Authoritative Game Logic
➢ Implement all game state management on the server side
➢ Validate all player moves server-side before applying them
➢ Prevent client-side manipulation or cheating
➢ Broadcast validated game state updates to connected clients

❖ Matchmaking System
➢ Enable players to create new game rooms
➢ Implement automatic matchmaking to pair players
➢ Support game room discovery and joining
➢ Handle player connections and disconnections gracefully
❖ Deployment
➢ Deploy Nakama server to a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean,
etc.)
➢ Deploy the frontend application with public accessibility or share mobile
application with us
➢ Provide deployment documentation

Optional Features (Bonus Points)
❖ Concurrent Game Support
➢ Handle multiple simultaneous game sessions
➢ Implement proper game room isolation
➢ Ensure scalable architecture for multiple concurrent players
❖ Leaderboard System
➢ Track player wins, losses, and win streaks
➢ Implement global ranking system
➢ Display top players with statistics
➢ Persist player performance data
❖ Timer-Based Game Mode
➢ Add time limits for each player's turn (e.g., 30 seconds per move)
➢ Implement automatic forfeit on timeout
➢ Extend matchmaking to support mode selection (classic vs. timed)
➢ Display countdown timers in the UI

Deliverables
